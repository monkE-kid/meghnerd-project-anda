# Project ANDA by Meghnad S.
This is a public repository to list all the resources, documents, guides and whatever was used and learnt from Project Anda by Meghnad S.
Meghnad S. is a content creator who creates long form content on society, politics and public policy. He has a YouTube channel named [Meghnerd](https://www.youtube.com/@meghnerd) where you can find all his videos. 

## What is Project Anda?
On *10 Jan 2025* Meghnad announced on his youtube page that he was running for the Delhi state elections, on in his words "glorified municipal corporation Delhi?" as an independent candidate. 
Project Anda is basically the name of his political experiment - to see, or really *show* that a commom citizen -who breathes the  same polluted air, the same polluted water, travels in the same traffic congested city etc can go and get his name on the ballot. 
In the process, he wants to document his entire journey- from getting the nomination form from the District Magistrate's office to filing it, from running a campaign with volunteers to making a manifesto based on policies for the public. The reason being that 'if there are tutorials for lots of things, why not there be a tutorial for becoming a elected public representative?'. The entire process will help any person who in the future wishes to contest his/her/their local elections as an independent.

This public repository serves as a single point of information for project Anda - consisting of all the documents, forms and well written vlogs on the process of how to fight the elections as a common citizen.
## How can I contribute? I know nothing about Github, or how to do things here?
You don't need to know much about Github to write, or contribute on this repository. Even I don't know much about this, but its an honest effort to learn and tackle the challenges.
**What is a repository?**
A repository is basically a collection of things. Those things can be code, images, videos, books documents etc. This is repository. We call repositories as 'repo' in short.
**How to contribute?**
Basically, whatever we write here, we write it in a Markdown format. You must have seen the .md extenstion to the README file as 'README.md', that .md stands for te markdown extension. Its basically a file format - like .txt. or .jpg or.png or .apk etc.
You can learn more on how to write with markdown from the web and more resources that I'll attach here later, but firt let me show you some basics.

- You can give headings by '#' like
\# Heading 1
# Heading 1
\#\# Heading 2
## Heading 2
\#\#\# Heading 3
### Heading 3
\#\#\#\# Heading 4
#### Heading 4
- You can **bold** text by placing it within two star symbols like  \*\***hello**\*\* and you can *italicize* by plaing them within single star symbols like \**Hello*\*. Remember, there should be no spaces between the star symbol and your character.
- You can create hyperlinks, i.e. link to a website or video by using \[insert topic name here\]\(insert the link here\). Here is a link to Meghnads channel - [Meghnerd](https://www.youtube.com/@meghnerd). This is written as: \[Meghnerd\]\(https://www.youtube.com/@meghnerd \).

You can learn more commands, just by viewing this easy to read and use [document](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) on how to write in markdown. I'll keep updating and simplifying this guide as I get more and more info and ***TIME!!*** I have my first semester exams (yes I am a student!) going on so I am going as much as I possibly can from my side. This is just my very small, little but very passionate, help and contribution to the huge courage of Mr. Meghnad to fight the elections. 

*THANKS!!* :\)
