# Project ANDA by Meghnad S.
This is a public repository to list all the resources, documents, guides and whatever was used and learnt from Project Anda by Meghnad S.

Meghnad S. is a content creator who creates long form content on society, politics and public policy. He has a YouTube channel named [Meghnerd](https://www.youtube.com/@meghnerd) where you can find all his videos. 

## What is Project Anda?
On *10 Jan 2025* Meghnad announced on his youtube page that he was running for the Delhi state elections, or in his words "glorified municipal corporation Delhi?" as an independent candidate. 
Project Anda is basically the name of his political experiment - to see, or really *show* that a common citizen -who breathes the  same polluted air, the same polluted water, travels in the same traffic congested city etc can get his name on the ballot. 
In the process, he wants to document his entire journey- from getting the nomination form from the District Magistrate's office to filing it, from running a campaign with volunteers to making a manifesto based on policies for the public. The reason being that 'if there are tutorials for lots of things, why not there be a tutorial for becoming a elected public representative?'. The entire process will help any person who in the future wishes to contest his/her/their local elections as an independent.

This public repository serves as a single point of information for project Anda - consisting of all the documents, forms and well written vlogs on the process of how to fight the elections as a common citizen.
## How can I contribute? I know nothing about Github, or how to do things here?
You don't need to know much about Github to write, or contribute to repository. Even I don't know much about this, but its an honest effort to learn and tackle the challenges that come along the way.

**What is a repository?**
A repository is basically a collection of things. Those things can be code, images, videos, books documents etc. This is repository. We call repositories as 'repo' in short.

A repository is like a folder on your computer - it has various files and also other folders. Similary, this repo has files and folders for various things. You can navigate the repo like you would navigate a normal file system. 
- Click on a folder to go into it
- Click on a file to open it, you can download that file by clicking the download option on the top right.

**How to contribute?**
Basically, whatever we write here, we write it in a Markdown format. You must have seen the .md extenstion to the README file as 'README.md', that .md stands for the markdown extension. Its basically a simple text file format - like .txt. Writing here is like writing a document in Word, but much easier.
You can learn more on how to write with markdown from the web and resources that I'll attach here later, but first let me show you some basics.

- You can give headings by '#' like
\# Heading 1
# Heading 1
\#\# Heading 2
## Heading 2
\#\#\# Heading 3
### Heading 3
\#\#\#\# Heading 4
#### Heading 4
- You can **bold** text by placing it within two star symbols like  \*\***hello**\*\* and you can *italicize* by plaing them within single star symbols like \**Hello*\*. Remember, there should be no spaces between the star symbol and your character.
- You can create hyperlinks, i.e. link to a website or video by using \[insert topic name here\]\(insert the link here\). Here is a link to Meghnads channel - [Meghnerd](https://www.youtube.com/@meghnerd). This is written as: \[Meghnerd\]\(https://www.youtube.com/@meghnerd \).

You can learn more commands, just by viewing this easy to read and use [document](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) on how to write in markdown. I'll keep updating and simplifying this guide as I get more and more info and ***TIME!!*** I have my first semester exams (yes I am a student!) going on so I am doing as much as I possibly can from my side. This is just my very small, little but very passionate, help and contribution to project Anda, along with lots of other people and volunteers like me.

- You can edit a file by, first opening it and then clicking the edit - 'pen' option on the top right of the pane the file is open in. After editing click the
  'commit changes' button at the top right of the pane. The **commit changes** button is basically aksing you if you want to
  save your changes. The naming and description box you see are basically the name of the change and the description.
  *Why is it like this?* Since its a public repository, any changes you make is tracked so that it can be reversed easily. So
  everytime you *commit a change* it enters the change into a a **log** or **register**. It's done so its easy to track changes
  and undo them if anything goes wrong. Its recommended that you give a short name to your change, and give a one line description
  of what kind of change you made - i.e. updated something, added something etc.
  **Example:** Say you update this README file and correct some spelling errors.
  - You can name your change as *Updated readme file* with the description as **checked for spelling errors and corrected some of them**, or you can write it in yourr way, but
    keep it short and to the point.
    
  This is a good pactice beacuse if anybody spams or makes trouble with the repo, we can simply go back to the last major change and all edits that were done after that change
  will be removed.

I hope we can together create a good public repository for project Anda, ans make sure it helps anyone in the future who wants to contest elections as an independent.

*THANKS!!* :\)
PS - This document is a constant work in progress and will be constantly kept updated, just like the entire repo, well until the elections are over.
